day1: Maximum Subarray - case failed, didn't think of only negative numbers in solutions
How did it solve : Kept the max value as Integer.MIN_VALUE at start.

day2: Two sum - I solved after inserting keys into hashmap and iterating. Each test case gave me something new to add to the code. Good thing is my code didn't fail on the inputs, but bad thing is I didn't handle the scenarios beforehand.
